# Flutter iOS Tabs

An example Flutter app to show how you can implement iOS style tab navigation, complete with multitasking.

- The bottom tab bar is persistent between pages.
- Multitasking support. From the "Browse" page and tap a color. Then go back to home, and again back to Browse. The selected color still is shown.
- If you're currently on a child page and tap the parent tab, it will navigate back to the parent page.
- Example of how you can navigate between tabs outside of the tab bar.
